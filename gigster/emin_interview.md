Gigster

I cofounded an events company with a friend after graduating. I focused on outputting quality work and making sure the creative direction

2 masters - computer science and civil systems
I see on linkedin and from reading some of your quora answers you are very smart individual
How do you see Gigster accomplishing its goal of becoming the world's engineering department
- Gigster is 2 years old. You've been working at Gigster for 6 months now. How do you see Gigster's trajectory on accomplishing this goal
How is Gigster as a company, is it a fun place with problems to solve


dev shop - software of the world
40 to 100. not excede that

AI look through the convo btwn sales team and client
or build a tool

lambda project, standardize modular like lego

docker - containers with source controlled dev environment
source control



dev culture - strict qa process
educate - pair programming
transparency
7-8, one remote in portugal - gigsters on gigsters

core team -
scrum - agile dev project - every monday - two week sprint
no one can pull us out



Gigster.com uses React

What kind of internal tools have you guys created already to help track earnings, what is a tool that you are looking to create next? Or are you just trying to better refine and optimize the tools you have

Looks like a product manager takes each client and inquery and walks through the potential project with them. Now I've been a part of a team at facebook where we pushed towards automating incoming request and inqueiries (now I can't go into detail about it but I can say these inqueires are probably not as big as the ones gigster receives) since your inqueiries are but potential software projects that these companies need for their own company to grow and move forward
I see automation in these parts to be tricky but also possible
All Uber apps or lookalikes can be created with a "base code" or template app that can be automated then refined with a team of engineers (this then accelerates the pipeline in pushing out the product to consumers)

IF there are no termination costs, did the clients already put down a down payment or does Gigster just absorbed the loss in time thus revenue



Emil on learning machine without learning math and theory
<!-- Yes it is very possible.

The same way you can build a dam without going through all the civil engineering. Trial and error. Did you know we did not need to know civil engineering to build impressive structures? We can simply try and see what works. It is more fun and it is easier maybe. It is also more expensive time and resource wise; and sometimes you cannot have the luxury of trial, e.g. you cannot build a dam upstream of a small town and try to see if it holds. So in the end you will be able to build things but who would use your ability if your time and resource consumption is not optimized? who can make more buildings given the same amount of steel and concrete? the one that knows exactly how much steel and concrete is enough for exactly what application.

The same thing applies to machine learning. You can get into python and scikit learn and attack a dataset with all the algorithms you have. Then sooner or later a challenge will come up, say an unbalanced dataset. No matter what you do your random forest and logistic regression does not beat the highest accuracy anymore. Then you need to come up with a custom solution, write a logistic regression with an uneven link function. What is a link function? what is logistic regression? how does it work? how is it estimated? what is maximum likelihood? what is a distribution? Then you need to go through the math and stats.

It depends what you want to do with it ultimately. Do you want to have it as a hobby? go ahead scikit learn off the shelf is perfect. Do you want to compete in the job market? Then no.

Here is a general rule, the easier something is the more people learn it, and hence there is less demand for it. It is very simple for a developer to look at scikit learn’s syntax and use it in a day without knowing whats going on. Thus why would a company with “a” developer hire a machine learner to do the same.

I don’t mean to discourage you however, if practicality fuels your curiosity to dig deeper in the math by all means do it. It is the case for myself. But you will reach a limit in your capabilities with no math and stats, and that limit is not too high. -->

Education as deep learning

<!-- I would suggest you edit your tags to say education as deep learning and machine learning are a branch of statistics and computer science and they don't mean learning something thoroughly as a human.

Yet I am an educator myself, and I would say the best way to understand something and not memorize it, is to understand the reasoning behind it. For instance why is sine squared plus cosine squared always equal to one? Try it, draw a right triangle put its sides as a,b and the hypotnuse c. Sine of one of the angles then will be a/c, the cosine b/c. Then sine squares is (a/c)^2 and cosine squared is (b/c)^2. Add them up and on the numerator you will have a^2+b^2, then according to pythegorean theorem, the numerator is c^2. Thus you will have 1.

I would suggest you understand everything twice, once mathematically ie prove it, and once conceptually, what does it mean? How can you explain it to your grandma?

And if you want to master something you must practise it a lot. Understanding is one part of the learning process and a huge part is indeed memory and what you have seen before in your practices. -->



Machine learning

https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-learn-programming-AI-and-machine-learning-Where-do-I-start

It really depends what you want to do. Machine learning covers a very wide range of interests So when you say you want to be very good at it by next September, I am not sure what is "it". But I will assume you want to know enough to be able to make your choice.

To become a machine learner, you must be very good at math and statistics, and very good at computer science. So your route will go down those paths. But to start, given your short time I will suggest the following courses from Udacity. I like Udacity better because they make online courses, versus putting a class online.

Go to Udacity , click on data science tab, and take these courses:

Intro to Computer Science(for python)
Intro to Data Analytics(for pandas and numpy)
Intro to Statistics
Intro to Machine Learning
(Linear Algebra if you are lacking)
At this stage you must be able to run an off the shelf classification or regression problem using scikit-learn. I would suggest you not using R. While many people like it, inferior to python for many reasons. Also use jupyter as your development environment, you will love it.

You must realize though that when using packages, sometimes you will not get the results you are looking for. That is when you will realize you do not know enough about how the methods really work. And then you must embark on another journey to deepen your insight in Linear Algebra, Inferential Statistics, Statistical Models, Algorithms, Optimization and so on.

Personally I love Nando de Freitas' courses on youtube. He explains really well and his homeworks are very informative.

Other good courses are edX's CS188 and CS189. Youtube CS170 UC Berkeley is also fundamentals.

I would emphasis again it really depends what you want to do with it and that defines how deep you want to go. But Statistics, Linear Algebra and CS should be in your tool box. As you advance I will highly encourage finding communities or coaches to learn with.

Nothing beats projects. There is data everywhere on the web and it is free. So have fun with it.

Lastly, do not get discouraged, I think Machine Learning is making huge advances and might change many things. It is awesome you are interested in it early on. So keep it up and if need be, take it slow. Deep Learning is the hot topic these days, so I would suggest looking into it later in your studies.

Whenever you feel like you have mastered everything on the web, Michael Jordan, the head of the statistics department at UC Berkeley, who was an advisor to Andrew Ng of Stanford and Nando de Freitas, has a list of books to read through 3 times.
