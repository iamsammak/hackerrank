Gigster's company mission sounds awesome. What has been one of its biggest hurdles?
Gigster was founded in 2014

Read this in a tech crunch article
Once you get your project back, Gigster will even maintain the code, and you can pay to add upgrades or new features.
<!-- How does Gigster maintain the code, so not only is it a freelance hub but it also a warehouse storage for old projects, how does it have the bandwidth for this. And if so how is that cost broken down? -->
big picture goal
  - library of code, plugin and play

Article back in 2015
Gigster does have some limitations. It specializes in engineering, not design. Its projects ship with sleek, functional UI, but if a buyer wants some premium beauty splashed on their project, they may have to look elsewhere or let Gigster connect them to someone.
<!-- Is Gigster limited in the design side of things still? -->

Now his heart’s set on smoothing the friction of software development for everyone else. “Outsourcing” doesn’t have to be a dirty word.

<!-- Could you tell me more about Gigster's AI that delivers quotes -->
The lauded venture firm was impressed with Gigster’s artificial intelligence engine. It converts a client’s product proposal into a development plan, and helps Gigster’s army of remote developers plug in pre-made code blocks to efficiently build the app.


so some typical questions I asked are what sort of stack are:
- - what is your stack? why did you pick those things?
  - php if stand only
  python, node react, coffeescript flavor

  mongoDB - into postgres

  most valueable
  is Understanding
  build upon - other ppl can build upon


  If I wanted to create a web application - what concerns do I have to consider
  Front end and back-end are separate
  Load balancers

  How do we make sure that the request is secure (I think he was hinting at cookies)

  load balancer


- what is the culture/team like?
    100 core team by the end of the year
    more of hit the ground running
    building out this year
    just putting an engineer manager in place
- what are you guys working on at the moment? what would I be working on if I were to join right now?
- how would you say the company helps new grads like myself, eg fostering new talent
- also be prepared to talk about your background, motivations, and maybe a bit about your projects


the most important one I think is asking what their test coverage is like
every tech person has eaten that one up so far
- Emphasize that testing is important to your productivity lol
- If you don't know the tech stack, ask what it is and why they chose it
- I also asked each person what their favorite and least favorite thing about the company was
  teammates
  startup mode
  least fav - working long hours, passion about what they are building
- How is mentoring?
- What problems have you run into when scaling the user base?
- What's the goal of the company and how can a new employee help out?
- What is your group working on right now?


From Ronnie from Slack

when its time for you to ask questions
ask technical questions
ask questions that show you know what it takes or what you need to be an engineer at that company
what is your tech stack
how code gets written and how code gets pushed out
TDD, ask them about testing code
- capybara
- you've done assessments so you have learned how to read specs and pass them

what are they hiring for
what problems are they trying to solve

if you see that most companies are using a specific framework, go learn that framework, read up on it

what's source control


get datapoints from each interview, then ask the next engineer what they are doing about said problem that you learned from the last interview
what are the reasons you are using all those tools
and what you should think about in those situations

if you end the interview without new information about the industry then you haven't spent your time wisely

who will be looking over my code
hopefully someone will read your code first
write test for it
see if it breaks anything
then it goes implemented with master

how is the onboarding period like

if the company has a great answer for that, might be a nice company to work for
