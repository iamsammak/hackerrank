Once you get your project back, Gigster will even maintain the code, and you can pay to add upgrades or new features.

big picture goal
  - library of code, plugin and play

Article back in 2015
Gigster does have some limitations. It specializes in engineering, not design. Its projects ship with sleek, functional UI, but if a buyer wants some premium beauty splashed on their project, they may have to look elsewhere or let Gigster connect them to someone.
<!-- Is Gigster limited in the design side of things still? -->

so some typical questions I asked are what sort of stack are:
- - what is your stack? why did you pick those things?
- what is the culture/team like?
    100 core team by the end of the year
    more of hit the ground running
    building out this year
    just putting an engineer manager in place
- what are you guys working on at the moment? what would I be working on if I were to join right now?
- how would you say the company helps new grads like myself, eg fostering new talent
- it's harder if the person isn't from a technical role, was Maura the recruiter?
- also be prepared to talk about your background, motivations, and maybe a bit about your projects


the most important one I think is asking what their test coverage is like
every tech person has eaten that one up so far
- Emphasize that testing is important to your productivity lol
- If you don't know the tech stack, ask what it is and why they chose it
- I also asked each person what their favorite and least favorite thing about the company was
  teammates
  startup mode
  least fav - working long hours, passion about what they are building
- How is mentoring?
- What problems have you run into when scaling the user base?
- What's the goal of the company and how can a new employee help out?
- What is your group working on right now?
